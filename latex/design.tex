    \caption{\label{fig:vectors} Each paper should have a killer
    figure 1 that captures the essence of the approach idea. It
    can happen that figure 1 is a great related work comparison
    and then it will require a second system architecture
    figure.}

  How do we acheive that lofty goal? 
  %
  Well of course by solving several unsolved challenges.
  %
  The section sub headings in this paragraph should roughly
  align with those core original contributions and highlight
  both the overall design and key technical challenges and
  solutions in doing so.
